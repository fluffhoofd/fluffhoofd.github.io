        <h2>A proof that my cat is the master of the universe</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                Take the following proposition P:<br/><br/>
                (P)  <i>If P is true, then my cat is the master of the universe.</i>
                <br/><br/>This statement doesn't seem to be necessarily true. But we can at least consider the possibility of it being true. What if it is? If P is true then P being true entails my cat being the the master of the universe. And since we assume that proposition P referenced in P itself is true, we can deduce the following true statement:
                <br/><br/>
                (1)  <i>If P is true, then my cat is the master of the universe</i><br/><br/>
                Notice that with statement 1 we just assume that P is true. We need an additional step to actually prove that that is the case. 
                <br/>I hope you already noticed that statement 1 and P are actually the same sentence. This gives us statement 2: <br/><br/>
                (2)  <i>Statement 1 is the same as P</i><br/><br/>

                But if statement 1 is the same as P, and statement 1 is true, then:
                <br/><br/>
                (3)  <i>P is true</i><br/><br/>

                So following the truth of P, the conclusion must be:<br/><br/>


                (4)  <i>My cat is the master of the universe</i><br/><br/>

                Checkmate atheists! Of course, me being enslaved by the cat in question, I knew this fact all along...

            <h2>Some thoughts on science and metaphysics</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                What is it that science is about? Should we consider the praxis of science as being aimed for the discovery of the nature of objective reality? Or perhaps it should be about human flourishing? 
                Before we can even start formulating an answer to these questions we have to think about the human condition in relation to the notion of reality.
                Science is a plural phenomenon involving many domains, but what they have in common is that for each domain, science can be conceptualized as the praxis in which people aim to achieve understanding about this domain.<br/>
                Although most people have a general idea of what we mean with 'understanding', it is still a good idea to explicate it a bit more. 
                So what is it ​exactly​ that science intends to achieve? Is it to <i>explain</i> phenomena?  To <i>understand</i> reality? Or maybe to <i>discover</i> the laws or entities of nature. 
                Although more aims can be thought of, they all share an important aspect: they are all closely linked to certain metaphysical presuppositions. 
                In other words: they commit to certain claims about the nature of reality. It is by discussing these presuppositions that we can get a clear view of what a realistic aim of science should be. 
                There are also non-metaphysical aspects, like achievability, or the notion of progress, that should be taken into account when trying to forulate what it is that science aims to achieve. Let's take a look at them first. After that, we will try to answer the main question by asserting the claim that the aim of science is to ​extend the body of <i>intersubjective</i> knowledge​.
                </p>

                <h3>Non-metaphysical aspects</h3>
                <p>
                One important aspect of science is that we cannot demarcate science from dogmatic belief if we do not suppose that our current body of explanations, understanding or discoveries is incomplete. 
                The aim of science should be tightly linked with a notion of progress and therefore self-criticism. 
                We thus need to add a notion of extensibility to our aim because we want to be able to extend our understanding, explanations or discoveries.
                In addition, it is infeasible to conceive of the aim of science as something in the sense of trying to get a ​complete​ picture of reality. 
                Not only can we still do science without such a claim, we would also have a new problem for we would need to come up with criteria to determine if the aim has been reached. 
                Having these kinds of criteria requires us to take an impossible overarching perspective to compare our views about the world with the world itself. 
                But this would in turn result in a new view about the world. And so we enter an infinite regression.
                </p>

                <h3>Metaphysical aspects</h3>
                <p>
                Most candidates for an aim of science can be divided in a realist and anti-realist camp. 
                Many arguments have been given for or against scientific realism, but they all agree more or less on its main thesis stating that reality in itself, independent from human existence, consists of the entities and laws the way science describes them. 
                But it is no surprise then, that when we define realism this way, we are going to have a hard time defending realism. 
                All kinds of problems arise when we think of reality this way. 
                Take for example Hillary Putnam’s interpretation of the referential inscrutability thesis<sup>1</sup>: How can the concepts used in a fully consistent theory be made true by referring to the external world if we have no way of investigating how our concepts refer to reality in a meaningful way? 
                And then of course solutions like constructive empiricism are proposed to sort of cover up the problem by stating that scientific language/explanations fall in the pragmatic domain and don’t count as real knowledge for as far they are not about the observable world.
                I think that, in light of these problems, we have to take a more genealogical approach to find out where the idea behind such a discrete distinction between humans and reality comes from.
                At a certain point in history René Descartes came along and introduced an idea that turned to be very influential for the western style of thinking. 
                Even philosophers like Kant and Leibniz still operated in the framework Descartes layed out. 
                Their idea was that the way we humans are most rational is when we are completely disengaged from the world. But this can of course not be the whole story. The level of scientific and technological success we have achieved is unthinkable without practical and social involvement. Thinking rationally and taking a disengaged stance will in itself not be enough of a conception of the way science works. 
                What we need is a new ​intersubjective ​way to be a realist about scientific discoveries, in order to avoid the pitfalls of classic realism or subjectivism.
                </p>

                <h3>Intersubjectivity</h3>
                <p>
                The key aspect of an aim of science should be epistemic in nature. 
                We are trying to gather knowledge after all. 
                But what kind of knowledge? The answer is: the aim of science should include a notion of ​intersubjective knowledge.​ Consider the following idea: For all knowledge claims p we will never be able to justify the step from H(p) to p where H is the predicate of being human knowledge.​ 
                In other words, all knowledge is necessarily qualified as being human knowledge.
                From the perspective of David Hume’s problem of induction this means that even if we would have observed every instance of some entity or phenomenon, our knowledge is still qualified with H.
                Notice that Bas van Fraassen seems to make a similar statement about absolute knowledge when he said we should be agnostic about the ontological status of theoretical entities or laws of nature, and only count the observable parts of empirically adequate theories as knowledge<sup>2</sup>. 
                There are nonetheless some differences between an intersubjective view and van Fraassen's constructive empiricism. 
                We should not only count the observable parts of empirically adequate theories as knowledge because if we accept that all observational sentences are qualified as human observational sentences, we may have a new way of going about the ontological status of the objects expressed by these sentences. 
                Namely, by looking at the very language we use. It would be too blunt to exclude the option that our language not only constitutes the way we look at our world, but even determines our world. 
                So when we ask ourselves ‘are there really electrons moving through this vacuum tube?’ we should not necessarily be obliged to say that we only have access to the empirical data and therefore cannot make claims about the ontological status of electrons.
                </p>

                <h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
                <p>
                We have discussed arguments for why an aim of science should include a notion of extensibility. This means we should be humble about our knowledge claims and stay open for criticism. Afterwards, we looked at the concept of intersubjectivity and saw that the importance of our engagement with the world is something that should not be easily overlooked. So, Without a clear view of extensibility and intersubjectivity we can’t have a fruitful conception of what science intends to achieve.
